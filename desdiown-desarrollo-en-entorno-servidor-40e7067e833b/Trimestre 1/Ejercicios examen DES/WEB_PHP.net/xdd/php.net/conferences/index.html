     <p><a href="https://2017.phpce.eu/">phpCE</a> is a first edition of the community conference for PHP programmers and enthusiasts. The meeting was stablished by merging two nation-wide events: PHPCon Poland and Brno PHP Conference. This edition will take place in the Ossa Congress &amp; Spa Hotel near Rawa Mazowicka, Poland on November 3rd - 5th.</p>
     <p>The unique feature of the php Central Europe Conference is three-path split of agenda, according to difficulty level of talks: Relaxing, Intermediate and Geek. Submitting a talk you must point a proper level and suggest the Program Committee, which one do you prefer. In general, talks given in the Relaxing path should be done in native language of hosting country (Polish this year).</p>
     <p>We strongly encourage potential speakers to submit more than one submission on more than one topic. The more submissions you contribute, the more options you give us to pick you. Be sure your talk title and abstract define the exact topic you want to talk about and what you hope people will learn from the session. In previous years, some submissions sounded interesting but we just didn't have enough detail for them to make the final cut.</p>
     <p>php Central Europe Conference is not limited to just PHP-related talks. There have been sessions covering a wide range of topics supporting PHP developers and DevOps as well, and we encourage you to "think outside the box" to come up with your own unique topics. To get the ideas flowing, here's a few suggestions:</p>
     <ul>
     <li>APIs (REST, SOAP, etc.),</li>
     <li>Case Study,</li>
     <li>Continuous Delivery,</li>
     <li>Database,</li>
     <li>Design Approach,</li>
     <li>Development and Maintennance,</li>
     <li>Devops Life,</li>
     <li>Frameworks and CMSes,</li>
     <li>PHP Involved Technologies,</li>
     <li>Project Management, Team Building,</li>
     <li>Profiling and Performance,</li>
     <li>Security,</li>
     <li>Testing,</li>
     <li>UI/UX,</li>
     <li>Upstream,</li>
     <li>and other.</li>
     </ul>
     <p>When the Call for Papers closes, the organizers will sort through the submissions, making their selections. Speakers will be notified as soon as the selection process has been completed.</p>
     <p>Our speaker package for this year's event includes:</p>
     <ul>
     <li>Full conference pass,</li>
     <li>2 complimentary hotel nights,</li>
     <li>Additional complimentary night (Thu/Fri) for speakers who decide to attend in our Opening Day for Speakers,</li>
     <li>100% reimbursement of airfare/travel costs for international speakers (arriving outside Poland),</li>
     <li>Lunch, dinner, receptions and all other activities included in regular conference,</li>

        We are glad to announce that we’ll be organizing the 11th edition of the Dutch PHP Conference, which will be
        held in Amsterdam from June 29th to July 1st 2017. Thursday 29th will be the tutorial day and June 30th and July
        1st will be the main conference days. DPC brings together the best speakers and PHP, Javascript and front-end
        talent from Europe and beyond for three days of high-level technical sessions. Our
        <a href="https://www.phpconference.nl/schedule" title="Schedule | Dutch PHP conference">schedule</a>
        is already online and features a variety of talks on PHP, DevOps, Security &amp; privacy, microservices, JavaScript,
        databases and much more; so come along to our two main conference days on June 30 and July 1 in Amsterdam.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>In-depth tutorial sessions</strong><br/>
        The tutorial day on Thursday June 29 at the same venue gives an opportunity for a smaller number of attendees to
        spend some time with an expert, going in-depth on particular topics - topics like Docker, domain modelling, Mob
        programming, ES6, Drupal8, Progressive Web Apps and more are all on offer. These are small groups so that
        presenters can respond to individual questions, and as a result places are limited.
      </p>

     <p>For the first time, the PHP Tour will take place outside of France: AFUP and the locale branch of Luxembourg will welcome you at the Abbey of Neumünster, a historical venue in the heart of Luxembourg City. English speakers? Come and join us, many talks will be proposed in english.</p>

<p>AFUP, The French PHP usergroup, is glad to announce that the fourth edition of the PHP Tour will be held in Luxembourg City on May 12 &amp; 13, 2015. PHP experts will share their advanced knowledge and experience with developers, decision makers and companies, during keynotes, sessions and workshops.</p>

<p>This year, just around the corner of Amazon and Microsoft offices, the event will be partly focused on the theme "PHP &amp; the Cloud": tools, continuous integration, security, costs... But of course, a lot of talks will be about PHP itself, innovation and improvement. Julien Pauli, Thibaut Lenclos, Wim Godden, Oswald de Riemaecker and François Zaninotto are the first speakers confirmed for the event. Who will join this dream team? Stay tuned to discover the program in the next few days. 
Presentation length is 45 minutes which includes question time. 3 hours workshops with limited audience are planned on Wednesday.</p>

<p>Still not convinced? This year, we celebrate PHP's 20th birthday, and AFUP's 15th birthday: book your ticket right now, and come to party with us! You’ve got your ticket ? Please book your hotel room as soon as possible : there are not so many hotels in Luxembourg-City, and May is a busy period in town.</p>
